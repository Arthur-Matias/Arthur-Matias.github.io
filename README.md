## About the Stack

The technologies used were Svelte & Sapper.

 Svelte is a JavaScript framework that promises to solve some problems that we have with technologies like React or Angular, for example the amount of dependencies and additional libraries needed for the framerowk to work. Its syntax is very similar to React and I would say that sometimes even more intuitive, another advantage of Svelte over React is reactivity, to simulate this in React we work with states or contexts. At Svelte we have it natively and without complications.

And if Svelte is a React, we can say that Sapper is the NextJs. Sapper is a framework for Svelte (Just like NextJs for React), responsible for server-side rendering, and also other things like route management.

My site in production weighs just 3.3MB, which equates to approximately 30x less than a simple React project. The boot time is only 1 ~ 3 seconds.
